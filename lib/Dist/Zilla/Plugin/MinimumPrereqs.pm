=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MinimumPrereqs - Adjust blank prereqs to use the lowest version available

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ; ...other Prereq plugins...
    [MinimumPrereqs]
    minimum_year = 2008  ; default

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This plugin will scan for any "blank" pre-requirement (ie: C<<< Module => 0 >>>), search MetaCPAN
for the lowest version that was released at least within C<<< minimum_year >>>, and fix the prereq
to contain that mimimum version.

=head2 Why bother?

Put your money where your mouth is.  If you say that you can support B<any version>, like
L<http:E<sol>E<sol>search.cpan.orgE<sol>~stevanE<sol>Moose-0.01E<sol>|Moose v0.01>, then actually commit to it.

What's that?  You don't actually think it'll work on the very first version of Moose?  Then
at least commit to something that was released in year 20XX.

=head2 Why not just use LatestPrereqs?

Some users prefer to download as little from CPAN as they need to, and keep their Perl
requirements in the same place as their OS requirements.  For example, Debian's apt system
has thousands of Perl modules, with all of the proper requirements and dependencies, thanks
to the L<http:E<sol>E<sol>pkg-perl.alioth.debian.orgE<sol>|Debian Perl Group>'s work to translate those
Perl modules to Debian packages.  This keeps OS dependencies clean and makes upgrades
seemless.

By maintaining accurate minimum prereqs, you can find a good happy medium between making sure
your module works for the right version ranges, and not promoting overly restrictive version
requirements.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 minimum_year

This is the lowest release year it will accept to add as a minimum requirement.  For example,
if you have a Moose requirement as C<<< Moose => 0 >>>, under the default year of 2008, it will change
this to C<<< Moose => 0.34 >>>, which was released in January 21, 2008.
