NAME
    Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Prereqs - Useful Prereqs modules in a
    Dist::Zilla bundle

SYNOPSIS
        ; Instead of this...
        [AutoPrereqs]
        skip = ^Foo|Bar$
        [MinimumPerl]
        [MinimumPrereqs]
        minimum_year = 2008
        [PrereqsClean]
        minimum_perl = 5.8.8
        removal_level = 2
 
        ; ...use this
        [@Prereqs]
        skip = ^Foo|Bar$
        minimum_year = 2008
        minimum_perl = 5.8.8
        removal_level = 2
 
        ; and potentially put some manual entries afterwards...
        [Prereqs]
        ; ...
        [RemovePrereqs]
        ; ...
        [RemovePrereqsMatching]
        ; ...
        [Conflicts]
        ; ...

DESCRIPTION
    This is a handy Dist::Zilla plugin bundle that ties together several
    useful Prereq plugins:

    *   AutoPrereqs

    *   MinimumPerl

    *   MinimumPrereqs

    *   PrereqsClean

    This also delegates the ordering pitfalls, so you don't have to worry
    about that. All of the options from those plugins are directly supported
    from within the bundle, via PluginBundle::Merged.
